        <p class="Portfolio-p">A few months before I left Hipertextual I began working on a new redesign proposal.</p>
        <p class="Portfolio-p">A year before that we decided to merge all our different sites into a single one, to group our audience under a single roof and unify our editorial efforts. We ditched our most famous brand, ALT1040, and took the name of the company as our new media brand. A year passed and it was crystal clear we had made a great call but our web design, that was meant to cover a single topic, fell a bit short with all these new topics scrambled together. </p>
        <p class="Portfolio-p">My intention was to make each topic stand out on its own and break the mold a bit in terms of layout. Itâ€™s not the most developed concept but I still remember it dearly ðŸ–¤.</p>
