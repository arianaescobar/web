        <p class="Portfolio-p">Telef贸nica was the most important client I worked with while  being in Hipertextual and one of the biggest projects we did together was the redesign of <a href="http://blogthinkbig.com" target="_blank" class="underline underline--burntbacon" alt="Think Big Website">Think Big.</a></p>
        <img class="Portfolio-web" src="../portfolio/images/thinkbig-website-01.png">
        <p class="Portfolio-p">Think Big is Telefonica's most important blog, focused on technology, science, and innovation. </p>
        <p class="Portfolio-p">They wanted to redesign the blog to improve its speed, functionality, and the overall look and feel of the site. So my team and I redesigned it trying to make it look more modern while keeping the classic blog layout which was important to the client.</p>
        <img class="Portfolio-web" src="../portfolio/images/thinkbig-website-02.png">
        <p class="Portfolio-p">We met with the Brand Department of Telef贸nica to make it appropriate with their new brand guidelines as well as working side-by-side with their project owner to help them achieve their goals.</p>
        <p class="Portfolio-p">It was quite a challenge because our client wanted it to be a responsive website but it also needed to look good on Internet Explorer 6, the most used browser inside the company.</p>
