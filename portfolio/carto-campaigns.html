        <p class="Portfolio-p">At CARTO, the Marketing and Design team work closely together. The design team is present and completely involved in every step, from lead generation, customer acquisition, product marketing to content generation.</p>
        <p class="Portfolio-p">We donâ€™t have any single dedicated designer for the Marketing team, instead, we all pitch in and get involved with all the different projects that require our work. This allows for a more unified design and mindset throughout the team and the final outputs, a constant role-switching that keeps things interesting and keeps us learning.</p>
